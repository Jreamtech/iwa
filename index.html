        <h2>1. Historical Context and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Korean beauty standards prioritize maintaining a youthful appearance
          rather than looking mature. A combination of clear skin, an even skin
          complexion, a slim v-shaped jawline, and pronounced puffy Aegyo-Sal
          (fatty, bag-like, deposits under the eye - common in children; rare in
          adults) contribute to the desirable youthful aesthetic and personal
          presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contemporary South Korea, beauty standards have been significantly
          shaped by globalization, Western influence, and the rise of the K-pop
          and K-drama industries. This has led to a shift towards more specific
          and often unattainable physical ideals, emphasizing certain facial and
          body characteristics.

      <!-- Section 2: Key Features of Ideal Beauty -->
      <section id="keyfeatures">
        <h2>2. Key Features of Ideal Beauty</h2>
        <p>
          Modern South Korean beauty standards often revolve around a youthful,
          innocent, and often doll-like appearance. These ideals are widely
          propagated through media, advertising, and celebrity culture.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1. Desired Facial Features</h3>
        <p>Several distinct facial features are highly sought after:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fair and Clear Skin:</strong> A luminous, blemish-free, and
            often pale complexion is paramount, symbolizing purity and health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"V-line" Jaw:</strong> A slim, sharp, and narrow jawline
            that tapers to a pointed chin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double Eyelids:</strong> A distinct crease above the eye,
            making the eyes appear larger and more open.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High, Defined Nose Bridge:</strong> A tall and narrow nose
            bridge is often preferred.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Small Face (Sogol):</strong> The overall size of the face is
            ideally small and oval-shaped.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Full Lips:</strong> Often a preference for plump,
            well-defined lips.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2. Preferred Body Proportions</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond facial features, specific body proportions are also considered
          ideal. These include a very <em>slim and slender figure</em>, long and
          thin legs, and a small waist. While traditionally a more voluptuous
          figure was appreciated, modern trends lean heavily towards a lean
          physique.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 3: Influence of K-Pop and Media -->
      <section id="kpopinfluence">
        <h2>3. Influence of K-Pop and Media</h2>
        <p>
          The global explosion of K-pop and K-dramas has significantly amplified
          and disseminated South Korean beauty standards worldwide. Idols and
          actors often embody these ideals, becoming role models for fans both
          domestically and internationally. Their flawless skin, precise facial
          features, and slim physiques set benchmarks that many aspire to
          achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media representation plays a crucial role, with beauty advertisements,
          television shows, and social media platforms constantly showcasing and
          reinforcing these specific aesthetics. This pervasive exposure
          contributes to the strong societal pressure to conform to these
          standards.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 4: Societal Impact and Criticisms -->
      <section id="societalimpact">
        <h2>4. Societal Impact and Criticisms</h2>
        <p>
          The stringent beauty standards in South Korea have a profound societal
          impact, contributing to immense pressure on individuals, particularly
          women, to conform. This pressure can affect self-esteem, mental
          health, and even career opportunities, as appearance is often
          perceived as a significant factor in personal and professional
          success.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1. Plastic Surgery Trends</h3>
        <p>
          South Korea has one of the highest rates of plastic surgery per capita
          globally. Common procedures include double eyelid surgery
          (blepharoplasty), rhinoplasty (nose jobs), and jawline reduction
          surgery to achieve the "V-line" look. These procedures are often seen
          as a means to achieve the desired beauty ideals and improve social
          standing.
        </p>
        <h4>4.1.1. Rise of Non-Surgical Procedures</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to surgical interventions, there's a growing trend towards
          non-surgical cosmetic procedures. These include various injectables
          like Botox and fillers for facial contouring, as well as advanced skin
          treatments such as laser therapy and chemical peels, all aimed at
          achieving a flawless and youthful appearance without invasive surgery.
